I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at UW with Sham Kakade. My primary area of focus is
enabling intelligent systems through the automated discovery of solutions and mastery
through experience. Another area of focus is deploying these intelligent entities to
embody robotic systems. My undergraduate degree was in electrical & computer engineering
and biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon.
