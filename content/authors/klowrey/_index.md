Howdy!

I am currently a Master's student with [Sidd Srinivasa](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/siddh) in the [Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/). I also work with Emo Todorov and his students in the [Movement Control Laboratory](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/). I am primarily interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent machines to acquire general notions of intelligence in order to robustly solve complex and temporally-extended tasks in real-world settings. I've previously interned at NASA JPL Robotics, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Blue Origin.
