I am currently a Master’s student with Sidd Srinivasa in the Personal Robotics Lab.
I also work with Emo Todorov and his students in the Movement Control Laboratory. I am
primarily interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent machines to
acquire general notions of intelligence in order to robustly solve complex and
temporally-extended tasks in real-world settings. I’ve previously interned at NASA JPL
Robotics, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Blue Origin.
