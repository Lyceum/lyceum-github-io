# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a fourth year PhD student at UW with Sham Kakade and Emo Todorov. I also
    collaborate with Sergey Levine, and work part-time at Google Brain as a student
    researcher. I am interested in the mathematical foundations and applications of
    machine learning. My current research leverages learning and optimization to endow
    robots with a vast repertoire of skills. To this end, I draw upon deep reinforcement
    learning, model-based control, and meta-learning.

Howdy!

I am currently a Master's student with [Sidd Srinivasa](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/siddh) in the [Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/). I also work with Emo Todorov and his students in the [Movement Control Laboratory](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/). I am primarily interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent machines to acquire general notions of intelligence in order to robustly solve complex and temporally-extended tasks in real-world settings. I've previously interned at NASA JPL Robotics, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Blue Origin.
